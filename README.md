# site-template-connextcms
This is a template for customizing ConnextCMS for a new website

This repository is being actively developed. It is not ready for general use.


# Plugin & New Site Considerations
The main things that a plugin or new site will need to modify on a ConnextCMS install is:
* Keystone Misc Files
  * /keystone.js - Probably want to add or modify parts of this file, or at least replace the original.
* KeystoneJS Routes
  * routes/index.js - need to modify or insert instructions into this file
  * routes/api/ - just need to copy files into this directory
  * routes/views/ - just need to copy files into this directory
* KeystoneJS Templates
  * templates/views/index.hbs - Will want to replace this default file.
  * templates/views/dashboard.hbs - Will want to append parts to this file. **Not sure how to do this**
    * *I may be able to create a div at the end of all the view divs. Make sure it's not of class 'container'. I can then create a Backbone view that loads the plugin views into this div.*
  * templates/views/layouts/default.hbs  - Will want to modify parts of this file.
  * templates/views/ - May want to add files to this directory.
* KeystoneJS Models
  * models/ - Will want to add or replace files in this directory.
* Public directory
  * /public/images/ - Will want to add images to this directory
  * /public/styles/ - Will want to add files to this directory
  * /public/js/ - Will want to add files to this directory
  * /public/js/lib/ - Will want to add files to this directory
  * /public/js/cms_common.js - Require.js file. Each plugin can have its own file like this that gets loaded after this one.
* Backbone
  * /public/app/model/ - Will want to add files to this directory
  * /public/app/templates/ - Will want to add or modify files in this directory
  * /public/app/views/ - Will want to add or modify files in this directory
  * /public/app/ - May want to add whole new directories here containing Backbone applications.
  * /public/app/templates/leftMenu.html - Will want to modify this to add new views to the menu. **Not sure how to do this.**
  * /public/app/views/leftMenuView.js - Will want to modify this to add new views to the menu. **Not sure how to do this.**


# New Site vs Plugin
Need to differentiate between Customizing a new site vs plugins:


* A plugin:
  * Will probably want to add an entry to the Left Menu View in the /dashboard.
    * If so, they'll want their own Backbone View and Template
  * Will probably need an API.
  * Will probably need both Backbone and Keystone Models.
  * May want to create a brand new Backbone app.
    * Which would need its own KeystoneJS View and Route
      * =2 new files + modification of routes/index.js file
  * Assumption: No need to modify the main keystone.js file.
  * Will probably want to load additional JavaScript libraries in the /public/js directory.
  * There can be zero to many plugins per site.
  * More appropriate if loaded into a `/private/plugins` directory
  
  
  * Examples of plugins:
    * eCommerce/Product Management
    * User Management
    * Logging work
    * Displaying website analytics summary
      
      
      
* A new site:
  * Will definitely want to replace the default.hbs and index.hbs files.
  * Will definitely want to replace the keystone.js file.
  * Will have its own JavaScript, CSS, and Font files.
  * There will only be one 'site' that may contain many 'plugins'
  * A site is more appropriate for a `./merge` file.
